Doubleganger
Brewed by: Tree House Brewing Company
Style: American Double / Imperial IPA, 8.2% ABV
This beer was conceived with the intent to push the concept of Doppelganger to 
the limit of flavor and intensity. Both the kettle hopping rates and dry hopping
rates were increased while keeping the base beer the same. The result is intense,
but also surprising in its balance and softness. The mouthfeel is viscous and
coating with flavors of overripe mango, dank citrus, and tropical fruit
balanced by a sharp but pleasant finish. A treat to warm you up as a true New
England winter takes hold!
